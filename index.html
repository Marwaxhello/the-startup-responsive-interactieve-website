            We believe that climate-tech startups have the power to make a significant positive social
            impact on a large scale. We want to help these startups get on their feet, faster. That’s why we’re
            investing €50.000 in a startup fund, providing promising pioneers with the tools they need to push their mission
            further.
        </p>  
        
        <h2>Who’s behind this</h2>
        <p>
        GRRR is a creative digital agency for Meaningful Matters. We strive to make the world cleaner, fairer and more
        colourful, and have been working towards this mission for over 20 years now. We were the first Dutch digital creative
        agency with a B-Corp certificate, and our focus on impact strategy, inclusive design and ethical tech has been
        recognised with 33 international awards and nominations. Seeing our work realised in the success of companies like The
        Ocean Cleanup (with xx result), Fastned (with xx result) and SkyNRG (with xx result) is what keeps us going.
        </p>

        <h2>Good design for a better planet?</h2>
        <p>
        Design goes beyond what looks nice. It’s your brand's personality; how it looks, talks, reacts and interacts with
        people. Good design can make a brand easier to understand, to use, more memorable and more accessible. It gets your
        mission across and your message out there. That’s why we're funding climate-tech startups; we want to give them the
        power to stand out, to make even more impact, to be even more successful, and ultimately, to build towards a more
        sustainable future.
        </p>

        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>
            You’ll enter the brand-pressure-cooker, a fast-paced brand
            immersion, together with our team of brand identity experts. We’ll guide you through the process of (re)defining your
            mission and messaging, followed by visualising your brand, over the following four phases:
        </p>
        
        <lu>
            <li>Phase One: Brand Strategy</li>
            <li>Phase Two: Visual Identity</li>
            <li>Phase Three: Communication Tools (pitch deck, storyline, tone of voice guidelines)</li>
            <li>Phase Four: One page Website</li>
        </lu>

        <p>At the end of the process you’ll be armed with a clear</p>
        
        <h2>Who’s eligible?</h2>
        <p>
            Applications are open to climate-tech companies who are on the early stage of their startup journey. Applicants will be
            assessed based on the questions answered in the application form, but must also be able to:
        </p>
        
        <lu>
            <li>Provide input and feedback</li>
            <li>Be available to invest time in the process</li>
            <li>Be agile and willing to work under high pressure</li>
        </lu>

        <p>
            We’d like to ensure the fund applicant is chosen fairly and accurately. GRRR will form a small, confidential panel to
            review the applications. If there is no clear candidate, GRRR reserves the right to either extend the deadline or
            postpone the fund until there is a suitable applicant. All work submitted will remain confidential and not disclosed to
            third parties.
